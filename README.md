# SEC

This project uses the SEC API (https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation) to check for filings with today's date.
If the filing has not been checked then it will email it to you. 
Script requires you to run it in the same folder as your list of stock tickers, which should be saved as a CSV.
